# Welcome to "TELR"

The goal of "TELR" is to implement a simple API service that translates a Pokeman name to a Shakespearean description.

# The development process

I develop this service during my spare time, so you can monitor the progress of my efforts [here](https://github.com/lordkada/telr/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

Basically, I will develop using a [Gitflow](https://leanpub.com/git-flow/read) approach and release new versions of the software according to the milestones above.

# Run the software

In order to run the code from the terminal, type from inside the project folder:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The webserver responds to _http://localhost:8080/_
